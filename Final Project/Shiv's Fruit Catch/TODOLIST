Game:
    HUD:
        health
        score
    
    Make bouding box and sprite line up

    Upgrades:
        SpeedBoost gets recharged by speed fruit
        Bigger Basket upgrade using mario mushroom, or by picking up a bigger basket.
        health fruit

    bombs also fall from sky, when touch player, or caught in basket -> explosion  
        getting hit by bomb makes health go down one
    
    occasionally obstacle you need to jump over appears (turtl shell)

    Game over when health goes to 0

    no win, just lose, and when you lose you can see your score.

    Can activate fruit frenzy mode where losing fruit does not lower score, and fruit spawns are increased for short amount of time?

    Remove constants from player
    Fix Sprite class to make it better

    make my fast speed actually useful

    add Background

    Penalty for not cathcing fruit?
        Little Buddy makes fail face, lose some score.
