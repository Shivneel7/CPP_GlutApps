    HUD:
        health
        score
    
    Upgrades:
        SpeedBoost gets recharged by speed fruit
        Bigger Basket upgrade using mario mushroom, or by picking up a bigger basket.
        health fruit

    getting hit by bomb makes health go down one
    

    Game over when health goes to 0

    no win, just lose, and when you lose you can see your score.

    Can activate fruit frenzy mode where losing fruit does not lower score, and fruit spawns are increased for short amount of time?

    make my fast speed actually useful
